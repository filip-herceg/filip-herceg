### Welcome!
### Who am I?
My name is Filip Herceg, a working student in Germany.
Employee at DSV-Gruppe and student at DHBW.
I have a little experience with C#, Java, Python and some of that webdesign stuff.
One of my major interests is the magnificent development of Machine Learning in recent times.
When I am experienced enough I intend to focus on that topic.
I might end up traveling a lot for that, who knows? Would be nice though.

### What are you currently working on?
My current project is an evolution simulation in various market evironments.
And of course not to fail the upcoming tests :)

###
More to come it is 03:49 already and I have still stuff to do.
Will continue in a few days probably.
